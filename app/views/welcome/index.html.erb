<h2>Welcome to Walkoff!</h2>
<p>
  The time is now: <%= Time.now %>

<p>This is an app created for #BaseballHackDay on 25 March 2017. When a baseball game is in a potential walkoff situation, our app will send out a tweet via the Twitter account @walkoffbot. This way you can stay informed about all the season's most exciting games!</p>
